'''
Given an array containing n distinct numbers taken from 0, 1, 2, ..., n,
find the one that is missing from the array.

For example,
Given nums = [0, 1, 3] return 2.

Note:
Your algorithm should run in linear runtime complexity.
Could you implement it using only constant extra space complexity?

Special thanks to @jianchao.li.fighter for adding this problem and
creating all test cases.
