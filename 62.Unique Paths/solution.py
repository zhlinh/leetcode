A robot is located at the top-left corner of a m x n grid
(marked 'Start' in the diagram below).

The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time.
The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid
(marked 'Finish' in the diagram below).

How many possible unique paths are there?


Above is a 3 x 7 grid. How many possible unique paths are there?

Note: m and n will be at most 100.
